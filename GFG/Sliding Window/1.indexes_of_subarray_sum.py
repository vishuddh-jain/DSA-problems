'''
Given an array arr[] containing only non-negative integers, your task is to find a continuous subarray (a contiguous sequence of elements) whose sum equals a specified value target. 
You need to return the 1-based indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements of this subarray. You need to find the first subarray whose sum is equal to the target.
Note: If no such array is possible then, return [-1].

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 7, 5], target = 12
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation: The sum of elements from 2nd to 4th position is 12.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], target = 15
Output: [1, 5]
Explanation: The sum of elements from 1st to 5th position is 15.
